Explanation:
The user types www.foobar.com and DNS resolves it to the IP of the load balancer.

The load balancer (HAproxy) distributes traffic to two backend servers.

Each backend server contains a web server, app server, and database node.

One MySQL database is the Primary (for writes), and the other is a Replica (read-only).

Infrastructure Components:
HAproxy (Load Balancer): Distributes incoming traffic.

Algorithm: Round Robin or Least Connections.

Active-Active Setup: Both servers respond to traffic simultaneously.

Primary-Replica Database: Only the Primary handles writes, Replicas handle reads.

Issues:
Database SPOF: Only one write node; failure impacts availability.

Security risks: No firewall or HTTPS protection.

Lack of monitoring: No visibility into health or metrics.
