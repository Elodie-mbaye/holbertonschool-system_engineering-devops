Explanation:
When a user types www.foobar.com into their browser:

The browser queries a DNS server to resolve the domain name.

The DNS returns the IP address 8.8.8.8 (configured using an A record).

The browser sends an HTTP request to the server at that IP on port 80.

The Nginx web server receives the request:

Serves static files directly.

Forwards dynamic requests to the application server.

The application server processes the logic and may query the MySQL database.

The response is returned to the user via the web server.

Infrastructure Components:
Server: A physical or virtual machine running all components.

Domain name: Human-readable name resolved via DNS.

DNS Record: www is an A record pointing to 8.8.8.8.

Nginx: Handles HTTP requests and routes them.

Application Server: Executes dynamic business logic (e.g., PHP).

Database (MySQL): Stores persistent application data.

Protocol: HTTP over TCP/IP.

Issues:
Single Point of Failure (SPOF): If the server goes down, the website is unavailable.

No scalability: Cannot handle increased traffic load.

No high availability: Downtime occurs during updates or restarts.
