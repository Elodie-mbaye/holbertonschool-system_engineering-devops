Explanation:
The user accesses the domain via DNS, which points to a load balancer cluster (Active-Passive).

The load balancers distribute traffic to separate web servers (Nginx only).

Web servers forward to dedicated application servers.

The application servers connect to a separate database cluster (Primary and Replicas).

Monitoring and security layers are present throughout.

Infrastructure Components:
Load Balancer Cluster: Provides high availability at the LB level.

Web/Application/Database Split: Each tier is deployed on its own server(s).

Modular Design: Improves scalability, isolation, and maintenance.

Monitoring/SSL/Firewalls: Full observability and security.

Benefits:
Easier to scale each component independently.

Fault isolation across services.

Stronger security and monitoring.
