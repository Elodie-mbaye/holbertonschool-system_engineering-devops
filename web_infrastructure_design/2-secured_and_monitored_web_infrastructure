Explanation:
The user accesses www.foobar.com using HTTPS.

A firewall filters requests before they reach the Load Balancer.

The Load Balancer handles SSL termination and forwards traffic.

Backend servers are behind additional firewalls.

Monitoring agents (e.g., SumoLogic) are installed on each server.

Infrastructure Components:
Firewalls: Block unauthorized traffic at multiple levels.

HTTPS/SSL Certificate: Encrypts traffic from client to Load Balancer.

Monitoring Clients: Collect logs and metrics (e.g., QPS, error rate).

MySQL DB: Same Primary/Replica setup as before.

Issues:
SSL Termination at Load Balancer: Internal traffic between LB and backend is unencrypted.

Single Write DB Node: Still a SPOF for write operations.

All-in-One Servers: Web, app, and DB on the same machines limits scaling options.
